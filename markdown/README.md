# Workshop-04

By: Tom Orekoya

## Emphasis

When merchandising companies *purchase inventory*, they pay GST or HST. However, GST or HST does not form part of the cost of the inventory because companies can get back any GST or HST they pay on purchases (by offsetting it against the GST or HST *they collect from customers_ by way of an input tax credit).

## Strong

Sales taxes add much complexity to the **accounting process** for a multitude of reasons. The accounting transactions described in this chapter are therefore presented without the **added complication of sales taxes**. We will learn more about sales taxes in Chapter 10.
